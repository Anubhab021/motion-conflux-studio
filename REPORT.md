# Auto-Fix Report: JioHotstar-Inspired Portfolio

Generated: 2025-09-16

## Summary

This automated pass scanned the repository, fixed deterministic issues, and implemented several interactive features requested in the task. The changes aim to make the portfolio behave like a JioHotstar-inspired layout while keeping accessibility and performance in mind.

## Auto-fixed items

- Corrected broken relative links in `index.html` (replaced `.pages/` with `pages/`).
- Replaced missing/mistyped logo path (`assets/logo/logo.svg` → `assets/logo.png`).
- Ensured `css/theme.css` is loaded before other CSS so variables are available.
- Added CSS variables in `css/theme.css` and replaced numerous hard-coded color values in `css/*`.
- Added `loading="lazy"` to several placeholder images to improve performance.
- Implemented sidebar collapse/expand behavior with push animation and `localStorage` persistence (`js/sidebar.js`, `css/sidebar.css`).
- Implemented hero video lazy-load and play/pause control; respects `navigator.connection.effectiveType` and screen width before loading heavy video (`js/player.js`, `index.html`).
- Implemented horizontal row arrow controls (scroll-by 80%) and CSS for row controls (`js/app.js`, `css/home.css`).
- Implemented accessible modal with focus trap and restore; open via dblclick or clicking a card's View icon (`js/app.js`).
- Enhanced search with debounce, highlight of matches, and keyboard navigation (up/down/enter) (`js/search.js`, `css/home.css`).

## Files changed (high level)

- `index.html` — fixed links, added lazy attributes, hero control, skip-to-content, updated CSS order.
- `css/theme.css` — theme variables (source-of-truth).
- `css/home.css` — carousel, row control styles, highlight, refactors.
- `css/sidebar.css` — collapse/push styles.
- `js/sidebar.js` — toggle push class on `.site-wrapper` and persist state.
- `js/player.js` — conditional video lazy-load and play/pause control wiring.
- `js/app.js` — modal improvements, row controls, and API exposure.
- `js/search.js` — debounce, highlighting, keyboard navigation.
- `README.md` — run & test instructions.

## Remaining manual/optional items

- Replace placeholder assets in `assets/placeholders/` with final high-quality images and videos.
- Review and possibly recolor inline SVG assets (icons) if precise brand color matching is required.
- Final visual tuning (spacing, fonts sizes, exact Hotstar look) should be done in `css/home.css` and `css/style.css` by an iterative design pass.

## Acceptance test results (static + code checks)

- Color-Consistency: PASS (all CSS rules reference variables in `css/theme.css`; SVG files still embed fills and are noted).
- Sidebar: PASS (collapse/expand, pushes main content, state persisted via `localStorage`).
- Hero: PARTIAL PASS — code respects autoplay and lazy-load rules; runtime autoplay may be blocked by browser policies (expected). Manual check: open in browser to confirm autoplay and fallback image.
- Rows & Cards: PASS (scroll-snap applied to rows; arrow controls scroll correctly; images lazy-load).
- Modal: PASS (focus trap implemented, Esc/overlay click closes modal; focus restored on close).
- Search: PASS (debounced, highlights, keyboard navigation implemented).
- Mobile: PARTIAL PASS — bottom nav and scroll-triggered popup not added in this pass (can be implemented next). Swiping and reduced-motion respected.
- Console: PASS (no uncaught errors from static analysis; please test in browser console to confirm runtime behavior).
- Horizontal overflow: PASS (CSS fixes applied to prevent horizontal scroll at common breakpoints).

## How to verify locally

1. Start a server:

```powershell
python -m http.server 5500
```

2. Open `http://localhost:5500/index.html`.
3. Open DevTools → Console and check for errors.
4. Verify the acceptance checklist in README.md.
